# Sales-Data-Dashboard
My dashboard analyzes a Sales Data dataset containing fields like region, product, quantity, sales, and profit. It includes KPI cards for Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Profit Margin. Visuals such as trend charts, bar charts, and segment-wise comparisons give a clear view of performance.
